# BMAD - Agent Framework & Documentation

This directory contains the BMAD (Business Logic & AI Development) framework tools and the generated documentation output.

## Directory Structure

- **`_bmad/`**: Contains the BMAD agent definitions, workflows, and core framework tools. This is the "brain" of the agentic system.
- **`_bmad-output/`**: The output destination for all generated artifacts.
  - **`project-knowledge/`**: (or root) Documentation files like `architecture.md`, `project-overview.md`.
  - **`planning-artifacts/`**: Product Requirements (PRD), Tech Specs, etc.
  - **`implementation-artifacts/`**: Code plans, test plans, etc.

## Usage

These files are managed by the AI agents. You generally do not need to edit the `_bmad` folder contents manually unless you are customizing the agent behaviors.

The `_bmad-output` folder serves as the single source of truth for project documentation.

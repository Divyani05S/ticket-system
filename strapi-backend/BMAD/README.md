# BMAD - Agent Framework & Documentation

This directory contains the BMAD (Business Logic & AI Development) framework tools and the generated documentation output for the Strapi Backend.

## Directory Structure

- **`_bmad/`**: Contains the BMAD agent definitions, workflows, and core framework tools. This is the "brain" of the agentic system.
- **`_bmad-output/`**: The output destination for all generated artifacts.
  - **`project-overview.md`**: Executive summary and tech stack.
  - **`architecture.md`**: System architecture and data models.
  - **`api-contracts.md`**: REST API documentation.
  - **`component-inventory.md`**: Backend module inventory.
  - **`source-tree-analysis.md`**: Directory structure explanation.

## Usage

These files are managed by the AI agents. The `_bmad-output` folder serves as the single source of truth for project documentation.

To regenerate or update documentation, use the **Analyst** agent.

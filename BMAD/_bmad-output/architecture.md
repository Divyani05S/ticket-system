# System Architecture

## Overview
The Ticket System is a decoupled, full-stack application following a **Headless CMS + Single Page Application (SPA)** architecture. It leverages Strapi for content management and React for the interactive user experience.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend (React 19)
- **Architecture**: Component-based UI with state-driven view management.
- **Routing**: Internal state-based switcher in `App.js`.
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional. Components request data via Axios and update local state to trigger re-renders.
- **Design System**: Atomic variables defined in `index.css` for centralized theme control (colors, spacing, typography).

### 2. Backend (Strapi 5)
- **Architecture**: Plugin-based Headless CMS.
- **Data Model**: `Ticket` collection type with fields for title, description, email, priority, and status.
- **API**: RESTful endpoints automatically generated by Strapi core.
- **Database**: SQLite used as the primary storage engine for rapid development.

### 3. Data Flow & Integration
- **Submission**: `react-frontend` -> `POST /api/tickets`
- **Tracking**: `react-frontend` -> `GET /api/tickets?filters[email][$eq]=...`
- **Dashboards**: `react-frontend` -> `GET /api/tickets?sort=createdAt:desc`

## Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Development**: Local environment (Node.js).
- **Environment Variables**: Managed via `.env` in backend (frontend `.env` pending).
- **CI/CD Configuration**: Not yet detected in the repository (.github/workflows missing).
- **Deployment Targets**: Suitable for Coolify, Vercel (Front-end), or Docker-based hosting.

## Security
- **Authentication**: Strapi `users-permissions` plugin is installed but Public role is currently used for ticket submission (anonymous).
- **Validation**: Strict client-side regex for emails; Strapi server-side validation for required fields.
